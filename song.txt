Jumping up and down the floor
My head is an animal
And once there was an animal
It had a son that mowed the lawn
The son was an ok guy
They had a pet dragonfly
The dragonfly it ran away
But it came back with a story to say

Her dirty paws and furry coat
She ran down the forest slope
The forest of talking trees
They used to sing about the birds and the bees
